# English Studies
This repository holds the files that I have prepared during my GRE &amp; TOEFL studies. Feel free to download and use them if you want!

Majority of the vocabulary here I have learned thanks to [Magoosh](https://magoosh.com/), which I strongly advise.

Also note that these files may contain Turkish notes in it.

## General Tips (TOEFL, GRE, IELTS, ...)

- Prepare yourself a document where words with similar meaning (or maybe synonyms) are adjacent. This is a very good practice because there will be times where you feel like you have seen a word with similar meaning in the document but you don't know where it is, therefore you would have to search for it. During this search, you technically revise a lot of words. As the document gets bigger, every word in it gets revised over and over.

- Try to use the words you have learned in a sentence. Be poetic and lyrical. At times, exaggerate by using very unique vocabulary just for the sake of it. This is useful because of a very simple fact: Learning 5 words and remembering their meaning can be hard if they are separate, but if you use them in a sentence all together, this creates a connection which you can access just by remembering the sentence alone. Kudos to brain for working like that! 

- Go to YouTube, and search for ''debate competition'' (m√ºnazara). Debate competitions are events where you will see good usage of vocabulary, coherent arguments, well structured sentences and so on. During a video, if you hear a word that you don't understand, learn it! Note it down to the document I mentioned before. You can also listen to how they form sentences and arguments, which increases your listening ability, and furthermore you might learn how they speak, which increases your speaking ability, and since this is a formal debate you can convert this speech to text, which would increase your writing ability. That is 3 in 1!
